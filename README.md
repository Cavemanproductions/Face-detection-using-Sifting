# Face-detection-using-Sifting
This project aims to detect an individual from a database of portraits of many individuals using technique of sifting to detect key-points and match them using technique of Flann.
The Portrait Recognition System is a project designed to accurately identify individuals from a database of portrait images. It utilizes the Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) algorithm for detecting and extracting distinctive keypoints from the portraits and then applies the Fast Library for Approximate Nearest Neighbors (FLANN) algorithm for efficient keypoint matching. By combining these techniques, the system achieves robust and reliable identification of individuals based on their facial features.
Introduction:
The ability to recognize and identify individuals from a large database of portraits is a challenging task with numerous real-world applications. The Portrait Recognition System aims to address this challenge by leveraging the power of computer vision algorithms. By extracting and comparing keypoint descriptors, the system can accurately match query images with the corresponding individuals in the database.
Keypoint Detection and Extraction:
The project employs the Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) algorithm for robust and invariant keypoint detection. SIFT detects keypoints at various scales and orientations, enabling the system to handle variations in pose, scale, and lighting conditions across different portraits. The SIFT algorithm identifies keypoints as distinctive regions in the image, such as corners, edges, or blobs.
Keypoint Description:
After detecting keypoints, the system computes descriptors that capture the unique characteristics of each keypoint. The descriptors encode information about the local appearance and structure of the keypoints, making them suitable for subsequent matching.
FLANN-based Keypoint Matching:
To efficiently match keypoints between the query image and the database images, the system employs the Fast Library for Approximate Nearest Neighbors (FLANN). FLANN is a versatile library that provides efficient algorithms for approximate nearest neighbor search. By using FLANN, the system can quickly find the closest matches for each keypoint descriptor, reducing the computational complexity of the matching process.
Database Creation:
Before recognition can take place, the system creates a database of portrait images along with their corresponding identities. Each individual's portrait is stored in the database, associated with a unique identifier. This database serves as the reference for recognition and comparison with query images.
Recognition and Identification:
Given a query image, the system applies the SIFT algorithm to detect and describe keypoints. These descriptors are then matched against the descriptors of the reference images using the FLANN algorithm. By comparing the distances between descriptors, the system identifies the closest matches and determines the individual's identity based on the best matching reference image.
Results and Evaluation:
The performance of the Portrait Recognition System is evaluated based on recognition accuracy and computational efficiency. A dataset comprising multiple individuals' portraits is used to test the system's ability to correctly identify individuals. The accuracy is measured by comparing the system's output with the ground truth labels of the dataset. Additionally, the system's runtime is analyzed to ensure real-time or near-real-time performance.
Conclusion:
The Portrait Recognition System demonstrates the effectiveness of the SIFT algorithm for robust keypoint detection and the FLANN algorithm for efficient keypoint matching. By combining these techniques, the system achieves accurate identification of individuals from a database of portrait images. The project showcases the potential of computer vision algorithms in the field of biometric recognition and holds promise for applications such as security systems, access control, and automated surveillance.
